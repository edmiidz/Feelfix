FeelFix -  Personal Issue Tracker - Feeling Diary

FeelFix is a personal issue tracker. If you are disturbed during your day, tracking such disturbances overtime can Provide insight, self-knowledge and an opportunity to transcend unhelpful fears, allow you to serve as an example to others, and lead a more fulfilling life. 

FeelFix is probably a misnomer. It’s more like a Feeling-Tracking-Attitude-Fixer. It's based on the Carl Jung quote “Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves” with elements from 12-Step Programs and CBT.

As an ammature Android app developer, I have hired Freelancers from Freelancer.com  to assist in the development of this app.

I do not have the time or budget to continue working on this on my own, so I'm making it open source under the MIT license. 

I'm hoping I can encourage others to contribute to this project so we can bring it to market and make it available to everyone. 

There's no iOS version at this time. It is mostly just a CRUD Application, with the most Advanced feature being its ability to sync up with a Google Drive Spreadsheet. The reason I chose this approach is because I did not want to store this very sensitive data on my own servers. I believe/thought everyone should be the custodian of their own very sensitive data, and can optionally choose to backup on Google Drive if they like. And obviously if they do not, and lose their phone, then their data is gone for good.
